# ðŸ”— Short-URL Project

Welcome to the **Short-URL** project! This is a simple URL shortener built using **Node.js** that allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.

## ðŸŒ± Project Purpose

I created this project as part of my journey in learning backend development. The main goals are to:
- Improve my coding skills
- Practice building real-world applications
- Get familiar with backend concepts and database integration

### ðŸš§ Local Development

For now, I'm using **MongoDB** locally with **Mongoose** to handle database interactions. This project is a great way for me to test my skills and learn. In the future, I plan to work on another project using **MongoDB Atlas** to explore cloud database solutions.

## ðŸš€ Future Plans

As I continue on this path in software development, I have some exciting plans:
- Dive deeper into cloud database solutions like **MongoDB Atlas**
- Develop more advanced features in upcoming projects
- Learn about deployment strategies and best practices

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

This project is purely for practice and skill enhancement. It reflects my commitment to continuous learning, and I'm eager to build more sophisticated applications as I progress. Thank you for checking it out!
